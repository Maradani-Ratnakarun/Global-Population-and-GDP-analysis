# 🌍 Global Population, GDP, and Climate Dashboard

This Power BI project presents an interactive and insightful dashboard exploring **global economic and environmental indicators** across countries and regions. It visualizes trends in **GDP, Population, Population Density, GDP per Capita, and Climate Change** using official data from the World Bank and NASA.

## 📌 Project Description

In this dashboard, we analyze how countries compare in terms of economic output and population distribution and how these relate to **climate change trends over time**. By combining GDP and population indicators with global temperature data, this project provides a comprehensive perspective on development, disparity, and sustainability.
